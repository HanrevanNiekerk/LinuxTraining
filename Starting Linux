Here are the essential commands to create and start working on a new project called "my-new-app":1. 
Create the Project Directory (Folder)
You'll use the mkdir command (Make Directory) to create a new folder for your project. 
It's best practice to create it inside your home folder (~) or a designated projects folder.
Bash
mkdir my-new-app


Tip: If you wanted to create a directory within a subdirectory that doesn't exist yet, you could use the -p flag (e.g., mkdir -p projects/my-new-app).2. 

Enter the Project Directory
Use the cd command (Change Directory) to move into the new folder so any files you create will be placed there.

Bash
cd my-new-app

Your prompt will likely change to show you are now inside the my-new-app directory (e.g., ~/my-new-app$).3. 

Create Basic Files
Now that you're in the folder, you can start creating the files needed for your project.
Create a README file

A README file is essential for GitHub; it describes what your project is and how to use it. 
We'll use the touch command to create the empty file.

Bash
touch README.md

Create a script or source file
For your Linux coding project, you'll likely want a shell script or a source file (like a Python or C file).

Bash
touch start.sh

4. Make Files Executable (If needed)
If start.sh is a script you intend to run, you must give it execute permissions using chmod:
Bash
chmod +x start.sh

5. View Your Setup
Use ls -l (list long format) to see your new folder structure and confirm the permissions:
Bash
ls -l

Output Example      Explanation  
-rw-rw-r--          README.md is a normal file (no execute permission).
-rwxrwxr-x          start.sh is an executable script (x).

Summary of Commands

mkdir my-new-app

*What I learned yesterday was how to create a VM Manager (Virtual Machine Manager), and I installed a Linux OS on it. That process made me understand how I would use virtual machines to create servers.

cp	      Copy	                                  Copies files or directories from one location to another.
mv	      Move	                                  Moves files or directories, OR renames a file/directory.
rm	      Remove	                                Deletes files or directories. (Use with caution! rm -r is needed for folders).
cat	      Catenate	                              Displays the entire content of a file on the terminal screen.
less	    None (Opposite of more)	                Displays file contents one page at a time, allowing you to scroll both up and down. (Good for large files).
head	    None (Literally "head")	                Outputs the first 10 lines (by default) of a file.
tail	    None (Literally "tail")	                Outputs the last 10 lines (by default) of a file. (Often used with the -f flag to follow real-time log files).
grep	    Global Regular Expression Print	        Searches for a specific pattern of text within a file and prints the matching lines.
find	    None (Literally "find")	                Searches for files and directories based on various criteria (name, size, type, etc.)
chown	    Change Owner	                          Changes the owner and/or group of a file or directory.

clear	    None (Literally "clear")	              Clears the entire content of the terminal screen.
df	      Disk Free	                              Displays the amount of free disk space on file systems. (Use df -h for human-readable output).
uname	    Unix Name	                              Prints system information (e.g., operating system, kernel version).

*These are simple basic commands for the Linux Terminal using your Linux with Coding

Backing Up a file

#!/bin/bash
# A simple script to back up a file by appending a timestamp.

# 1. Check if the user provided a file name (an argument)
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Error: Please provide a filename to backup."
    echo "Usage: ./backup.sh my_file.txt"
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Assign the first argument (the file name) to a variable
FILE_TO_BACKUP=$1

# 3. Create a timestamp
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")

# 4. Define the new backup file name
BACKUP_FILE="${FILE_TO_BACKUP}.${TIMESTAMP}.bak"

# 5. Copy the file
cp "$FILE_TO_BACKUP" "$BACKUP_FILE"

# 6. Print a confirmation message
echo "Successfully backed up ${FILE_TO_BACKUP} to ${BACKUP_FILE}"

Notes:
#!/bin/bash: This is called the "Shebang" line. It tells the system to run the script using the Bash shell.

$1: This refers to the first argument the user types after the script name (e.g., in ./backup.sh **file.txt**, $1 is file.txt).

if [ -z "$1" ]; then ...: Checks if the first argument is empty. If it is, it shows an error message and quits (exit 1).

date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S": This formats the current date and time into a neat string (e.g., 20251205_105330).

cp: The familiar copy command.

To save and exit in nano:

Press Ctrl+O (Write Out/Save).

Press Enter.

Press Ctrl+X (Exit).

Make the script executable
By default, files cannot be run as programs. We must use chmod to add the execute permission (+x):

Bash

chmod +x backup.sh

Test the script
Now, you can test it on your file.txt:

Bash

./backup.sh file.txt
You will see a confirmation message, and when you run ls -l, you will see a new file like file.txt.20251205_105330.bak!
